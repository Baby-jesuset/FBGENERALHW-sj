# Fix Log

This document tracks the fixes applied to the OJ Hardware codebase based on the production readiness review.

## Critical Bugs

### 1.1. Missing Server-Side Session Validation in Middleware
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The middleware did not validate user sessions, leaving protected routes exposed.
- **Fix:** Integrated Supabase session handling directly into `middleware.ts`. The middleware now checks for a valid user session on protected routes (`/account`, `/checkout`, `/admin`, and associated APIs). If no user is found, it redirects to the `/login` page or returns a 401 for API requests. The redundant `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` file was removed.

### 1.2. Ineffective Admin Authorization Check
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The `requireAdmin()` check was failing because the middleware did not properly authenticate the user session, rendering the admin panel non-functional.
- **Fix:** This issue was resolved as a direct consequence of fixing the middleware. With server-side session validation now in place, `supabase.auth.getUser()` in API routes will correctly identify the user, allowing the `requireAdmin()` check to function as intended. No further code changes were required for this bug.

## Performance Bottlenecks

### 2.1. Redundant Database Calls for Admin Check
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The `isAdmin` function was making two database calls on every admin-protected route, causing unnecessary latency.
- **Fix:** I created a SQL script (`010_add_admin_claim_to_jwt.sql`) to add an `is_admin` custom claim to the user's JWT upon signup. The `isAdmin` function was then updated to read this claim directly from the user's session, eliminating the extra database call and improving performance.

## Scalability and Reliability

### 3.1. Generic Error Handling in Authorization
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Authorization failures in `requireAdmin` were throwing a generic error, resulting in a misleading `500` status code instead of a `401` or `403`.
- **Fix:** I created a custom `UnauthorizedError` class in `lib/errors.ts`, updated `requireAdmin` to throw it, and modified all admin API routes to specifically catch this error. This ensures that authorization failures now correctly return a `403 Forbidden` status, providing clearer and more accurate error responses.

### 3.2. N+1 Query Problem in Order Retrieval
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The `GET` endpoint for user orders was fetching each order's items in a separate query, leading to inefficient database usage (the N+1 problem).
- **Fix:** I refactored the data fetching logic in `app/api/orders/route.ts`. The new implementation uses a single, more efficient Supabase query to retrieve both the orders and their associated items, completely resolving the performance issue.

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### 4.1. Lack of Transactional Integrity when Creating Orders
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Creating an order and its items were two separate database operations, which could lead to data inconsistency if one failed.
- **Fix:** I created a new SQL script (`011_create_order_with_items_function.sql`) that defines a PostgreSQL function to handle order creation within a single transaction. The API route for creating orders was then updated to use this function, ensuring that orders and their items are created atomically.

## 5. Best Practices & Code Quality

### 5.1. Cart State is Not Persistent Across Devices
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The shopping cart was only stored in `localStorage`, meaning it was lost if a user switched devices.
- **Fix:** I implemented a fully persistent, database-backed cart. This involved creating a new `cart_items` table, a new API route (`/api/cart`) to manage cart operations, and refactoring the `CartProvider` to use this API instead of `localStorage`. The cart is now seamlessly synced across devices for logged-in users.

### 5.2. Redundant Computations on Render
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The total item count and price in the cart were being recalculated on every render, which is an inefficient pattern.
- **Fix:** I wrapped the `totalItems` and `totalPrice` calculations in the `CartProvider` with the `useMemo` hook. This ensures that these values are only recomputed when the `items` array changes, preventing unnecessary calculations on every render.

### 5.3. Overly Complex useEffect in Cart Context
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** The main `useEffect` hook in the `CartProvider` was handling too many responsibilities, making it hard to read and maintain.
- **Fix:** The previous refactoring to a database-backed cart has already resolved this issue. The logic was broken down into a `useCallback` for fetching the cart and a much simpler `useEffect` for handling authentication state changes. The code is now cleaner, more modular, and easier to understand. No further changes were needed.
